abstract = {Higher education institutions are promoting the adoption of innovative methodologies and instructional approaches to engage and promote personalized learning paths to their students. Several strategies based on gamification, artificial intelligence, and data mining are adopted to create an interactive educational setting centred around students. Within this personalized learning environment, there is a notable boost in student engagement and enhanced educational outcomes. The MathE platform, an online educational system introduced in 2019, is specifically crafted to support students tackling difficulties in comprehending higher-education-level mathematics or those aspiring to deepen their understanding of diverse mathematical topics â€” all at their own pace. The MathE platform provides multiple-choice questions, categorized under topics and subtopics, aligning with the content taught in higher education courses. Accessible to students worldwide, the platform enables them to train their mathematical skills through these resources. When the students log in to the training area of the platform, they choose a topic to study and specify whether they prefer basic or advanced questions. The platform then selects a set of seven multiple-choice questions from the available ones under the chosen topic and generates a test for the student. After completing and submitting the test, the answers are recorded and stored on the platform. This paper describes the data stored in the MathE platform, focusing on the 9546 answers to 833 questions, provided by 372 students from 8 countries who use the platform to practice their skills using the questions (and other resources) available on the platform. The information in this paper will help research about active learning tools to support the improvement of future education, especially at higher educational level. Furthermore, these data are valuable for understanding student learning patterns, assessing platform efficacy, gaining a global perspective on mathematics education, and contributing to the advancement of active learning tools for higher education.}
