abstractNote = {Vehicle data consist of electric vehicle performance data collected directly from the vehicle during standard operations. Data were collected using onboard data loggers that were either installed by the project team or preinstalled by the original equipment manufacturer. Data recorded by the data loggers were made accessible via an online web portal or an application programming interface. Different data loggers were used (HEM, ViriCiti, and Geotab), and the method for each vehicle is defined in the vehicle attributes file. Some systems collected data on a “trip-level” basis, in which each row of a table represents a single trip (the period between a key-on and key-off event), whereas other data were collected on a per-day basis, in which each row represents a single day of operation. Data were collected over a range of data collection periods, depending on the project. Data have been anonymized by removing information or decreasing information resolution as necessary so that fleets are not identifiable. Due to the wide range of vehicle types represented and variation in data collection, data parameters and frequencies differ between vehicles and fleets The **Performance Data Daily/Trip Data Dictionaries** contain definitions for each available parameter associated with a vehicle’s operations, aggregated at either a daily or trip level. The parameters available will vary from vehicle to vehicle, but every possible parameter will be defined. The **Vehicle Attributes Data Dictionary** contains definitions for each available parameter associated with a vehicle’s physical and functional attributes and fleet context. The **Vehicle Attributes** table contains specific vehicle characteristics, coded to an anonymous Vehicle ID. This Vehicle ID can be used as a key between vehicle data and vehicle attribute tables. The **Vehicle Data** tables contain the data from each vehicle’s operations, aggregated at either a daily or trip level, coded to an anonymous Vehicle ID. This Vehicle ID can be used as a key between vehicle data and vehicle attribute tables. Data is being uploaded quarterly through 2023 and subject to change until the conclusion of the project.},
