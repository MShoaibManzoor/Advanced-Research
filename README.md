Simultaneous Forecasting and Anomaly Detection of Battery Deterioration in Electric Vehicles using Neural Networks.

Abstract:
  With the uprise in advancements towards a greener future for our planet, a number of emerging technologies have been taken aliking by the masses, electric vehicle (EV) is the name most commonly heard amongst which. The purpose of this project as self explanatory by the title is to study the most important aspect of the operations of EV and their optimization with the use of yet another important milestone of technology, the neural network, capability induced into a machine to mimic the human brain to its uttermost capacity, of course, if not identically.
